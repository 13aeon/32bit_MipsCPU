## 32bit_MipsCPU
It is a sh*t thing.
Our 32bit_Mips CPU with max frequency = 81.63MHz in FPGA under some optimization.
If you want to know what kind of optimization it is, please find it yourself.
LOL
## Something to say
Good luck to you guys looking for version.
There will be a long day for you to simulate and debug.
LOL

Oh, by the way. The style of this code is as shitty as the project itself. Never remind me of any inappropriate indent or variable name.
